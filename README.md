# ABTCares: Animal Bite Treatment and Care Management System

![ABTCares](images/ABTCares_Main.jpg)  

## 📌 Project Overview
ABTCares is a Python-based console application designed to manage patient records related to animal bite incidents. It allows healthcare workers to efficiently log, update, and search for patient details, track treatment progress, and ensure proper medical follow-ups. The system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles for modularity and maintainability.

## 📖 About the Project
Animal bite incidents require proper medical intervention to prevent complications such as rabies infection. ABTCares simplifies the process by providing a structured system to record, manage, and analyze patient cases, ensuring timely treatment and monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives
